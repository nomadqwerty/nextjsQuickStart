// TODO: upgrade to GPT4.

learning and training with gpt3.5

// prompts
// there are fact based prompts.

like:

who is fela kuti?

// there are also context-aware prompts, resembling a flow of dialoge.

like:

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// prompt engineering.
prompts in gpt, are basically inputs, my input determines my output.
when passing inputs to gpt, its good to provide context in the input.
this is good because chatgpt is a nlu and its context aware.

ie "write me an article about hiking"

ie "write me an article about hiking up hills in platue state at 5 am in the blistering cold".

consider both prompts, the first is plain and lacks context, while the second has context and this will result in a better output from gpt.

// core prompt elements.
// 1. goal 
// 2. context

// the goal is basically the main aim. still consider the above inputs, the main goal is to write an article, in this case about hiking. a goal is chatgpts main output objective.

// the context on the other hand can be divided into two, the role and (constraints and extra information)

the role is basically a persona we want chatgpt to emulate. for example we can further imprve the second input by adding a role.

"you are an experienced nigerian hiker with years of competing in long distance running. 

write me an article about hiking up hills in platue state at 5 am in the blistering cold."

the constraints and extra information, these should part of any good prompt, this provides chat gpt with more info on what to do, more detailed micro objects or micro goals.

let us improve our above prompt.

"you are an experienced nigerian hiker with years of competing in long distance running. 

write me an article about hiking up hills in platue state at 5 am in the blistering cold.

this article is targeted at nigerian nature enthusiasts, it should highlight the beauty of the terrain in platue state and the benefits of regular out door activity."


// adjusting chat gpt output with continues conversation.


// how contexts should be.

// short and focused sentences.
// important keywords , avoid unnecessary information.
// defining a target audience is helpful for chatgpt.
// define the tone, style and length.
// we can even tell gpt the data output we are interested in, json, csv,xml etc
