// with next js, we can create api endpoints for our app. next is built on node and node is made for server side javascript(building apis)

in the pages folder, creat an api folder(called only api), then in the api folder we create handler functions for request to the backend route.

const endpoint = (req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.json({
    status: "success",
    message: "endpoint working",
  });
};

export default endpoint;

// the handler will run for all methods that is used in request. to create handler for unique methods use the req.method property, this returns the method of request. works like express.


// pre-rendering data from internal rest api.
// when making requests from within the app, we can just execute the handler function by our selves. this is more optimal. this is for GET requests. 

// dynamic routes, with param values 
// file name should be like dynamic page files. [id].js
// we can access param values from req.query object.
// get the value and perfom needed operations.

// for routes with multi params use the ... operator, [...id].js.
