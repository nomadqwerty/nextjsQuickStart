nextjs a react js frame work for production.
makes building fullstack enterprise react apps.

// react is a client development library.

// nextjs builds up on react, more features, easier development process.

nextjs solves alot of problems faced in building react applications. state management, routing , authentication.

// nextjs features:
1. built in ssr: build and assemble client side code on the server and then serves it to the browswer. but the react code works like a regular react spa.

2. File  based routing: routing is used to change the pages of the rendered app with the url. next supports routing, in next it done by specifying a pages folder that will hold different components. this is acalled file based routing.

3. Fullstack react app: next js makes it possible to add a backend node app to our react front end app.


// start up a fresh next app: 'npx create-next-app'
// start dev server: 'npm run dev'

// what to cover.
foundation:
file based routing
page pre-Rendering
data fetching
combine react and next
Api routes and rest api design.

advanced:
optimization
underhood study and analysis
deployment and config
authentication.


/////////////////////next course features

// File based routing.
i. understand file based routing
ii. static and dynamic routes
iii. pages navigation

i. understand file based routing: used to construct pages and different routes for navigation

  /pages: pages referes to the root directory. www.domain.com/, 

    index.js- the react component is to be shown at the root path of the app. www.domain.com/

    about.js- any other file / sub directory outside of index.js, will be come a route on its own. www.domain.com/about, these are called name/static routes

    /products- sub directory routing. directory routes need index.js file to sereve as root path in the dir's route. sub dirs are used for nesting routes
        index.js - root file 'www/domain.com/products'
        [id].js - [] is used for dynamic routing, [] operator will hold a variable that will be used for dynamic routing(something like params in express)- www.domain.com/products/67864323443, for routes that will change, id,emails, etc.
